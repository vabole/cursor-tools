  - Support for multiple analysis types: summaries, transcripts, implementation plans, reviews, or custom analysis
  - Optional questions parameter for targeted insights about video content
  - Uses Gemini models which have native YouTube video understanding capabilities
  - Results can be saved to files for reference and sharing
  - Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` to be set in your environment or .vibe-tools.env file

- **Support for Reasoning Effort Parameter**: Added `--reasoning-effort` parameter to enhance the quality of responses for complex queries:
  - Supports `low`, `medium`, and `high` values for controlling reasoning depth
  - Compatible with OpenAI o1 and o3-mini models directly

The fix ensures that the promises returned by `queue.add()` are properly handled, allowing detailed scenario information to appear in test reports.

## [0.6.0-alpha.14]

### Added

- **GitHub Repository Analysis for Repo Command**: Added `--from-github` parameter to the repo command, enabling analysis of remote GitHub repositories without local cloning. This feature provides the same functionality previously available in the doc command, making it easier to get context-aware assistance for any public GitHub repository (e.g., `vibe-tools repo "explain the authentication flow" --from-github=username/repo-name`).

## [0.6.0-alpha.13]

### Added

- **Support for Custom Repomix Configuration**: Added support for `repomix.config.json` files to customize which files are included/excluded during repository analysis. This configuration file can be placed in the repository root and will be automatically detected by `repo`, `plan`, and `doc` commands, allowing for more precise control over repository content analysis.
- **Subdirectory Analysis for Repo Command**: Added `--subdir` parameter to the repo command, allowing users to analyze a specific subdirectory instead of the entire repository. This makes the repo command more efficient when working with large codebases by focusing only on relevant subdirectories (e.g., `vibe-tools repo "explain the code" --subdir=src/commands`).
- **Improved Model Name Resolution**: Enhanced model name handling across providers to better handle experimental and latest model versions:

  - Automatically resolves `-exp-*` suffixes to find stable model versions
  - Resolves `-latest` suffixes to the most recent compatible model
  - For ModelBox and OpenRouter: automatically finds models across providers without requiring provider prefixes (e.g. `gpt-4o` will find `openai/gpt-4o`)
  - Provides helpful suggestions when models aren't found, showing similar available models

- **Support for OpenRouter when using MCP**
- By default the `mcp` command uses Anthropic, but now takes a --provider argument that can be set to 'anthropic' or 'openrouter'
- MCP commands require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to be set in your environment
- The '--model' arg can also be used with the MCP command to set the OpenRouter model. It is ignored if the provider is Anthropic.

- **Google Vertex AI Authentication**: Added support for Google Vertex AI authentication using JSON key files or Application Default Credentials (ADC). This update maintains backward compatibility, continuing to support the direct API key string method, while adding additional authentication options. To use this feature, set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the path of your JSON key file or to `adc` to use Application Default Credentials. This enables access to gemini models such as `gemini-2.0-flash` via the Vertex AI. This feature introduces a new dependency: `google-auth-library`.

  - **Example: Using Service Account JSON Key**
    Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` to the path of your service account JSON key file:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="./path/to/service-account.json"
    ```
  - **Example: Using Application Default Credentials (ADC)**
    First, authenticate locally using gcloud:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
    Then set `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `adc` to use Application Default Credentials:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="adc"
    ```

- **New Test Command**: Added comprehensive test command for automated feature behavior testing:
  - **Real Command Execution**: Tests now execute actual vibe-tools commands in a controlled environment, validating real-world behavior instead of simulated outputs.
  - Parallel test execution with dynamic worker allocation for faster test suite runtime.
  - Scenario-specific output buffering for clean parallel execution logs, ensuring readability even with concurrent tests.
  - Progress tracking showing completed/running/pending scenarios, providing real-time feedback during test runs.
  - Execution time statistics including total execution time and time saved by parallelization, offering insights into performance gains.
  - Detailed test reports with:
    - Test scenario details and results, including clear PASS/FAIL status with visual markers.
    - Tool execution logs: Detailed record of each tool execution during tests, including arguments, outputs (stdout/stderr), and any errors, providing in-depth insight into test execution flow.
    - Approach summaries using Gemini: After each test scenario, Gemini is used to summarize the AI agent's approach, providing a natural language overview of the steps and tools used to solve the test scenario.
  - Test coverage includes various categories of scenarios: Happy Path, Error Handling, Edge Cases, and Performance.
  - Support for test asset management and references: Introduced a robust system for managing test assets, allowing scenarios to reference external files or inline content, improving test data organization and reusability.
  - Intelligent retry mechanism with exponential backoff: Implemented a retry system that automatically handles transient errors with exponential backoff and jitter, improving test reliability and reducing false negatives.
  - Enhanced error handling and reporting: Improved error messages now include detailed information such as error types, stack traces, and context, making debugging test failures more efficient.

## [0.6.0-alpha.7] - 2025-03-05

### Added

- **Improved ModelBox Provider**: Enhanced the ModelBox provider with improved model name handling. If a requested model is not found, vibe-tools now provides helpful suggestions for similar models. Error messages have also been clarified to better guide users on the requirement for provider prefixes when specifying ModelBox models.

  - **Example: Improved Error Message**
    If you use an invalid model with ModelBox, you will now receive suggestions:

    ```text
    Error: Model 'invalid-model' not found in ModelBox.

    You requested: invalid-model
    Similar available models:
    - openai/gpt-4o
    - anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet

    Use --model with one of the above models. Note: ModelBox requires provider prefixes (e.g., 'openai/gpt-4' instead of just 'gpt-4').
    ```

- Added support for MCP server overrides in the marketplace
  - Implemented hardcoded overrides in `MCP_OVERRIDES` map
  - Added override for google-calendar-mcp to use eastlondoner fork
